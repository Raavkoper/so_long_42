## Description

In this project I have made a 2d game. The goal of the same is to collect all the collectables. Once all the collectable are collected you are free to go to the exit. While you are on this journey you will have to avoid a wolf chasing you. As scary as he sounds he is very cute, although you have to be careful for his ability to jump over obstacles.

I have provided 5 different maps to play on. These maps are carefully parsed and tested to make sure that the game is playable.

Pixelart has been made for the game. The images are converted to xpm files and then used in the game. some of which are animated.

## How to play

- compile the game using `make` in the root directory, after this you can run the game using `./so_long <maps/map#.ber>`

- You can move around using `WASD`

- Dont get eaten by the wolf

- Collect all the collectables, if this isn't done the exit will not open

- Exit the game using `ESC`
